Ctrl-D  üî• move half-page down

gd  üî• go to definition/first occurrence of the word under cursor

fX  fall onto to next 'X', in the same line (X is any character)
FX  fall to previous 'X' (f and F put the cursor on X)

TX  til previous 'X' (cursor is behind X)

J   join, move next line below to the end of current line (but adds a space)
Jx  join like above, and remove the added space.
```

For ideavimrc, one can set up some extra actions such as moving to previous or next error locatoin
```
nnoremap g[ :action GotoPreviousError<CR>
nnoremap g] :action GotoNextError<CR>
```

## Folding
```

zR              Open all folds. This sets 'foldlevel' to highest fold level.
```

For ideavim, set up as such:
```
nnoremap zC :action CollapseRegionRecursively<CR>
nnoremap zO :action ExpandRegionRecursively<CR>
```


## Options

```

## Search stuff
```
/              find pattern
n              go to next found pattern

:! grep -rin -A2 -B2 --color --include=\*.md . -e 'yank'
                             use a grep command to show what md files from
                             current directory contains word 'yank' or 'Yank'
                             r: recursive, n: show line number, i: ignore case

## Copy Paste stuff

How to select a word, copy it and replace another word.
```
yiw	    Yank inner word (copy word under cursor, say "first").
...	    Move the cursor to another word (say "second").
viwp	Select "second", then replace it with "first".
...	    Move the cursor to another word (say "third").
viw"0p	Select "third", then replace it with "first".

üî• Copy a word and paste it over other words:

yiw	    Yank inner word (copy word under cursor, say "first").
...	    Move the cursor to another word (say "second").
ciw Ctrl-R 0 Esc	üî•Change "second", replacing it with "first".
...	    Move the cursor to another word (say "third").
.	    Repeat the operation (change word and replace it with "first").
...	    Move the cursor to another word and press . to repeat the change.

Copy text in quotes, and paste it over other quoted text:

yi"	    Yank inner text (text containing cursor which is in quotes).
...	    Move the cursor to other quoted text.
ci" Ctrl-R 0 Esc	üî•Change the quoted text, replacing it with the copied text.
...	    Move the cursor to more quoted text.
.	    Repeat the operation (change the quoted text and replace it with the copy).
...	    Move the cursor to more quoted text and press . to repeat the change.

Copy a line and paste it over other lines:

yy	    Yank current line (say "first line").
...	    Move the cursor to another line (say "second line").
Vp	    Select "second line", then replace it with "first line".
...	    Move the cursor to another line (say "third line").
V"0p    Select "third line", then replace it with "first line".

Deleting, changing and yanking text copies the affected text to the unnamed register (""). Yanking text also copies the text to register 0 ("0). So the command yiw copies the current word to "" and to "0.

yl /vy/xu     Yank current character. Composing the yank operation with the so often used "one character to the right" motion
```
