* Try fight with social media / Youtube addiction

* Regular fasting

## Weekly Goal
* Write a weekly work summary and note down
  - major accomplishment
  - perhaps something learned
  - perhaps something could be done better, less hurry, or some actions could have been avoided?

## 静心做事法
一定记住干活说话的时候不要急，要静心细水的来，包括打字😄 这样貌似可以更能集中精力。
* 能`慢`下来干事情，这样焦躁感觉会减少很多
* 能`慢`下来说事情，别人也能够更好的理解

记得年轻的时候，其实也包括现在，很多情况下还是干事情太急躁，包括打字都想打很快。
给人讲东西说话也快，着急别人理解慢。其实都可以慢下来，平着心去做事，有一种稳妥，
心静的感觉。

感觉这个可以每天早上起来回想一下。

## 拖延症

1. 从低期待开始
2. 寻找成就感
3. 设定期限
4. 远离干扰
1. 先搞五分钟再说
> 不管你面对的事情有多么困难，你有多抵触，多害怕，都不要逃避，因为没人能帮你做。而且往往你只需要迈出那第一步，剩下的第二步、第三步、第四步，都比你想象地要轻松很多

## Health tips
* Do more sports
- vitamin D, potassium and so on are important!
- listen to Dr. Breg

## Happier tips
* When bored, reach out to a good friend, some family menber, or a memtor for a chat.

## General tips
- From Daniel EK: pay attention to daily accumulation and compound effect after span of years, value the free time you have before you got kids
- About stock/market: for average people we can perhaps just do long term investment,
and buy in/after when you hear big crash news, and sell when your friends/relatives
asking you how to open trading accounts.
- You can never really predict the top of the market. If you feel things not correct,
the actual change might happen after days or months...
