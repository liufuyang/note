## General tips
- From Daniel EK: pay attention to daily accumulation and compound effect after span of years, value the free time you have before you got kids
- About stock/market: for average people we can perhaps just do long term investment,
and buy in/after when you hear big crash news, and sell when your friends/relatives
asking you how to open trading accounts.
- You can never really predict the top of the market. If you feel things not correct,
the actual change might happen after days or months...
