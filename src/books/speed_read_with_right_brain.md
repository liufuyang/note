# Speed Read with the Right Brain (David Butler) / Speed reading (Kam Knight)

Summary of the two books on speed reading.

## 👀 Impressions
> 💭 Indeed both book are giving some good tips, but the first one
> seems more repeating itself, while second one is thinner but gives
> more tips

## 🪄 Actionable Takeaways

Book one:
1. Read meaningful group of words at a time
2. Concentrate on whole ideas instead of words
3. Conceptualize the meaning of those ideas

Book two:
1. Read in chunks (even staring at spaces between words can work)
2. Use visual to conceptualize the meaning of words
3. Reduce number of fixations
4. Stop sub-vocalization, using humming/music?
5. Main sentences, subjects of each paragraph
6. Vocabulary (prefixes and suffixes), eye health (rest, massage)
