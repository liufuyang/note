# Probability and Statistics

Upon successful completion of this course, you will:

### At a conceptual level:

- Master the basic concepts associated with `probability models` .
- Be able to translate models described in words to mathematical ones.
- Understand the main concepts and assumptions underlying `Bayesian and classical inference` .
- Obtain some familiarity with the range of applications of inference methods .

### At a more technical level:

- Become familiar with basic and common `probability distributions` .
- Learn how to use `conditioning` to simplify the analysis of complicated models.
- Have facility manipulating `probability mass functions` , `densities` , and `expectations` .
- Develop a solid understanding of the concept of `conditional expectation` and its role in inference.
- Understand the power of `laws of large numbers` and be able to use them when appropriate.
- Become familiar with the basic inference methodologies (for both `estimation and hypothesis testing` ) and be able to apply them.
- Acquire a good understanding of two `basic stochastic processes` (Bernoulli and Poisson) and their use in modeling.
- Learn how to formulate simple dynamical models as `Markov chains` and analyze them.
